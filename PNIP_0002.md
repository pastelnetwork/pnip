### Abstract
This proposal outlines a significant overhaul of the Pastel Network's mining system, aiming to address the free-rider problem and align mining incentives with the long-term success of the network. The new model restricts mining to operators of Pastel Supernodes (SNs), integrating a mechanism where mining eligibility is contingent upon active SN operation and a substantial PSL collateral. This system is designed to mitigate market pressure from non-committed miners and enhance network security and decentralization, while maintaining a competitive and fair environment for mining participants and the security benefits that comes from Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus.

### Motivation
The Pastel Network has experienced challenges with its current Proof-of-Work (PoW) mining model, notably the economic pressure exerted by miners with no long-term investment in the network. This has hindered the PSL's market performance and the network's development. The proposed system aims to rectify these issues by limiting mining capabilities to committed network participants, thereby reducing the negative impact of speculative mining and ensuring a more stable economic environment for PSL.

### Specification
- **Mining Eligibility**: Only Pastel SNs with a locked collateral of 5 million PSL and running the required node software version can participate in mining.
- **New Block Header Fields**: Two new fields are introduced in the block header for "version 5" blocks: the PastelID of the mining SN and a signature of the previous blockâ€™s Merkle root by the SN's PastelID.
- **Supernode Validator API**: A new Python-based API server, `mining_block_supernode_validator`, facilitates the signing process, ensuring SNs can securely contribute to block validation without exposing private keys.
- **Mining Pool Modifications**: Updates to the S-Nomp mining pool software and the Stratum Pool library accommodate the new system, requiring miners to provide SN signature data for block submissions.
- **Dynamic Fee Adjustment**: Mining fees adjust based on network hash rate changes, maintaining service affordability and incentivizing hash rate growth in proportion to PSL value.


#### Supernode Requirements
- **Collateral**: Each SN is required to lock up 5 million PSL as collateral.
- **Operational Contribution**: SNs must contribute to the network's computational and storage needs, supporting services like decentralized file storage and machine learning workloads.
- **PastelID**: SN operators must register a PastelID, a unique identifier that doubles as a public/private keypair using the Ed448 digital signature algorithm. This ID is crucial for participating in the network's consensus mechanism.

#### Implementation Details

##### Block Header Modifications
- **New Fields**: Two additional fields are appended to the block header in "version 5" blocks:
  - **PastelID of an active SN**: This identifies the SN that has contributed to mining the block.
  - **Signature of the SN's PastelID on the previous block's Merkle root**: This ensures the integrity and commitment of the SN to the network's blockchain history.
- **Purpose**: These modifications ensure that only committed SNs, which have staked a significant amount of PSL and are actively contributing to the network, can participate in the mining process.

##### PastelID and Digital Signatures
- **Functionality**: The PastelID enables SN operators to sign arbitrary messages, verifying their identity and operational status without exposing their private keys.
- **Security**: By requiring the signature on the previous block's Merkle root, the system ensures that only current and actively contributing SNs can participate in mining. This mechanism prevents stockpiling of signatures and ensures the SN's commitment to the current blockchain state.

##### Mining Process
- **Mining Eligibility**: Only SNs that have an active status as part of the Validator `active-set`, demonstrated by their locked collateral and operational contributions, are eligible to mine new blocks.
- **Signing the Merkle Root**: The critical innovation in this system is requiring the SN's PastelID to sign the Merkle root of the previous block. This signature, unique to each block, verifies the SN's contribution and alignment with the network's current state.
- **Security and Decentralization**: This approach maintains the network's security by tying mining eligibility to substantial investment and operational contribution, thereby reinforcing decentralization.

#### Rationale
- **Addressing the Free-Rider Problem**: Restricting mining to SNs directly combats the issue of non-committal miners exploiting the network for short-term gains. By tying mining to significant investment and operational contribution, the network ensures that miners are stakeholders genuinely interested in the health and success of Pastel.
- **Leveraging Supernode Infrastructure**: SNs are not just miners; they are pillars of the network, providing essential services. This model ensures that the network's security and operational capabilities grow hand-in-hand.
- **Ensuring Network Integrity**: The requirement for SNs to sign the previous block's Merkle root with their PastelID guarantees that only current and active participants can contribute to block production. This adds a layer of security and accountability previously unattainable in traditional PoW systems.

### Implementation
- The core Pastel software (`pasteld`) will incorporate the logic for the new mining eligibility checks, signature verification, and block header modifications.
- The `mining_block_supernode_validator` API server will be made available for SN operators, providing a secure interface for block signing operations.
- The Pastel mining pool software will require updates to validate and process blocks mined under the new system, ensuring compatibility with the enhanced security and eligibility requirements.

### Addressing Potential Imbalances in Mining Power Distribution

A critical concern with the proposed supernode-exclusive mining model is the potential for disproportionate mining power if an entity controls a minimal number of supernodes but possesses significant hashing power. This could hypothetically allow a single supernode to dominate the mining process, undermining the decentralization and fairness the model aims to ensure. To address this, the Pastel Network introduces a novel approach to maintain competitive balance and equitable distribution of mining opportunities among supernodes (SNs).

To prevent the monopolization of mining by a few powerful entities, the Pastel Network implements a dynamic eligibility criterion based on the proportion of active SNs and their participation in the mining process:
- **Eligibility Criterion**: The eligibility for a supernode to mine a new block is not solely dependent on hashing power but is also contingent upon the relative distribution of active supernodes in the network. For example, if there are 100 active SNs, a single SN's chance to mine should ideally be around 1%.
- **Mining Attempts Regulation**: A mechanism has been devised where, after a supernode successfully mines a block, it must wait for a certain number of new blocks to be mined by others before it becomes eligible again. This number is set to 75% of the total number of active SNs, ensuring a fair and rotational mining opportunity among all SNs.

#### Implementation and Operational Details

- **`getminingeligibility` Command**: A new command is integrated into the `pasteld` software, allowing SNs to check their eligibility status for mining new blocks based on the network's current state. This ensures transparency and fairness in the mining process.
- **Dynamic Adjustment for Network Stability**: This eligibility mechanism dynamically adjusts to the network's state, ensuring that the mining process remains resilient and fair, even as the number of active SNs fluctuates. This approach mitigates the risk of network halt due to a lack of eligible miners and maintains a steady flow of block production.

#### Maintaining Competitive Mining

The Pastel Network's model retains a level of competition among miners, crucial for network security and operational efficiency:
- **Hash Power vs. SN Ownership Balance**: While hash power remains an essential factor in mining success, the requirement to proportionally own and operate supernodes according to one's share of network hash power ensures that mining power cannot be centralized through hash power alone.
- **Market Dynamics and Fee Structure**: The design intricately links mining dynamics with market forces, ensuring that as the value of PSL increases, so does the incentive for mining, balanced by the increased difficulty and the need for more supernode operation. This correlation ensures that transaction and service fees within the network remain reasonable and dynamically adjust to the network's economic conditions.

### Addressing Technical Challenges in the New Mining Model

#### Contingency Mechanisms for Supernode Failures

In the new mining model proposed for Pastel, specific measures have been implemented to address potential challenges that could disrupt the mining process. These measures are particularly focused on scenarios where a significant portion of Supernodes (SNs) become inactive due to unforeseen circumstances, such as widespread service outages.

##### Scenario Analysis

1. **Widespread Supernode Inactivity**: If a substantial number of SNs, for example, over 50%, become inactive suddenly due to an external issue (e.g., a major cloud service provider outage), there's a risk that all currently eligible SNs for mining could be affected. This situation could potentially halt the mining of new blocks indefinitely under the standard operation rules.

2. **Increased Mining Difficulty**: A scenario where the mining difficulty has escalated significantly due to the prevalence of ASIC miners, followed by a sudden disappearance of a large number of SNs (especially those utilizing ASIC mining), could lead to a situation where the remaining SNs, primarily relying on CPU-based mining, might not be able to mine a new block within a reasonable timeframe. This delay could be exacerbated by the stark contrast in hash power between CPU and ASIC mining capabilities.

#### Implemented Solutions

To mitigate these risks, the Pastel network introduces a dual-layered mechanism designed to ensure continuity in the mining process, regardless of the operational status of SNs.

##### 1. **Emergency Eligibility Mode**

- **6-Minute Countdown**: Upon the mining of a new block, a 6-minute countdown timer is initiated network-wide. If another block is mined within this period, the timer resets. However, if no new block is mined within the 6 minutes, the network enters a special state.
- **All SNs Are Eligible**: In this special mode, any active SN, regardless of its current eligibility status, can mine a new block. This temporary measure ensures that the mining process can continue even if a significant number of SNs are inactive. The requirements for a correct signature and the presence of the 5 million PSL collateral remain in effect to maintain network integrity.

##### 2. **Aggregation Period for Block Submission**

- **30-Second Aggregation Window**: Upon entering the emergency eligibility mode, an aggregation period of 30 seconds is introduced. During this window, SNs can submit their candidate blocks for the next blockchain addition.
- **Selection Criteria**: At the end of the aggregation period, the network evaluates the submitted blocks. The winning block is selected based on the longest time since the SN last mined a block, reviewing the past 10,000 blocks as a reference.
- **Tie-Breaker**: In the event of a tie, the deciding factor is the seniority of the SN, determined by the length of time since its creation. This method ensures a fair and decentralized approach to resolving potential block submission conflicts.

#### Practical Implications

The introduction of these mechanisms aims to address critical vulnerabilities in the new mining model, ensuring the network remains resilient against disruptions that could otherwise stall the mining process. These contingency measures are designed with the dual goals of maintaining operational continuity and upholding the decentralized principles foundational to Pastel's architecture. By implementing a flexible response strategy to potential SN inactivity, Pastel ensures that its network can adapt to various challenges without compromising security or decentralization. This approach reflects a commitment to ensuring the robustness of the mining process, crucial for the network's overall health and the stability of the PSL ecosystem.

### Security Considerations
The proposal includes several security enhancements, notably the requirement for SN operation and substantial PSL collateral for mining participation. This significantly raises the barrier to potential attackers, as acquiring and operating multiple SNs requires considerable investment. Additionally, the introduction of SN signatures on block headers adds an extra layer of verification, further securing the block validation process against fraudulent activities.

### Backwards Compatibility
This change is not backward compatible with existing mining operations. A network-wide upgrade will be required, involving updates to the `pasteld` daemon, SN software, and mining pool implementations. A transition period will be established to ensure a smooth migration to the new system, with detailed guidance provided to miners and SN operators.
