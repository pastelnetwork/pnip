# Pastel Network Improvements Proposals 

People wishing to submit PNIPs first should propose their idea or document to the community on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/qudewKS3kp) or by emailing the support@pastel.network mailing list. After discussion, please open a PR. After copy-editing and acceptance, it will be published here.

Having a PNIP here does not make it a formally accepted standard until its status becomes Final or Active.

Those proposing changes should consider that ultimately consent may rest with the consensus of the Pastel Network. Please review our [Governance Process](https://docs.pastel.network/basics/governance) for more details.
